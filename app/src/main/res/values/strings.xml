        Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific
                computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program.\nProgramming involves tasks such as            analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms\' accuracy and resource consumption,and the implementation of algorithms (usually     in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).\n
        <b>The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code,
        which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</b>
        The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task
        (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer,often for solving a given problem.\n
        Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects,
        including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.\n

    <string name="historyofCompPro">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm\n\n\n\n\n😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉\n\n😍😊😊😊😉😉\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\</string>
